# Collaborative Docs

> **Note:** This project is under development and not ready to be tested or used in production. Feel free to contribute by creating a pull request.

Using this project, you can create collaborative documents and invite members to edit the document in real-time. All documents are private by default and documents are persisted in a PostgreSQL database.

More information soon.
